# PhishFort | Protect
## Anti-Phishing Firefox Plugin

This is a port of the popular PhishFort Protect extension for Firefox.

The large majority of the code is identical to that on Chrome.
Minor changes were made to conform to Firefox's Browser API.

Finally, the original extension on Chrome linked to a static copy of JQuery. JQuery was only used for making web requests and has since been replaced with the Fetch API built-in to conform with Firefox policies on third-party libraries.

## Disclaimer and Motivation

This is a personally maintained project, and has NO affiliation with PhishFort or the PhishFort company.
I used PhishFort on Chromium and was dejected to find no port existed when switching to Firefox. I hope this fills that void.

Feel free to create issues, pull requests, or feature requests.
I do not anticipate major changes, but if there are enough feature requests I would be happy to rename/expand the extension as need be.

Happy browsing! ðŸ˜€
